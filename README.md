# Identity OS
Identity OS is a linux-based operating system. 
It focuses on Security, Programming, and Gaming (preferably in that order). 
It is designed to be a home operating system for non tech-savvy users but has settings to customize the operating system any way you like.
Identity OS has its own custom window manager called Lithium.

At least, that's the goal.

Identity OS is created using linuxfromscratch.org.
